# Downloading Glyph Tools

1. You can download the most recent version of the Glyph Tools here:
<div align="center"><h3><a href="https://github.com/SebiAi/custom-nothing-glyph-tools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download</a></h3></div>

2. Then **extract** the contents of the downloaded zip.
> [!WARNING]
> Do not try to execute/open *anything* while the content is still zipped!  
> Extract the content to a directory first and *then* use the Glyph Tools.

> [!TIP]
> Extract the Glyph Tools to a location that you can access easily and remember (e.g. a sub directory in your Documents directory)

> [!TIP]
> The wiki will refer to the location/directory you extracted the Glyph Tools to as the "[**\[Glyph Tools location\]**](./1_Terminology.md#glyph-tools-location)".

3. Then check out the wiki here to learn how to set up the tools and create your first [\[composition\]](1_Terminology.md#compositioncompositions):
